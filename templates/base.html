 <!-- What we're doing here is defining a block, or an area, that we can inject content into
from other pages.  
The difference between the percent sign and the double curly bracket notation that we've
used before, is that the double curly brackets contain an 'expression', which is outputting
something either onto the screen, or in this case, into our href.
The curly bracket and percentage are for statements that control the flow of our template, such
as a for-loop, if-statement, or this block element.-->
    {% block content %}

<!--next we are going to delete everything but the contents of the other pages...
    they will display just the same-->
